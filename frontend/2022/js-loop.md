关于for循环和loop循环，今天复习的时候看见一个很妙的比喻。

> Think of eating like a while loop: when you start taking bites, you don’t know the exact number you’ll need to become full. Rather you’ll eat while you’re hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.

就像你吃饭，当你开始吃的时候，你并不知道你会吃多少口。但如果你饱了你就会停下。在编程中，当我们不知道我们要执行多少次循环次，while循环就是最好的选择。

### 回调函数
> We call the functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked callback functions because they get called during the execution of the higher-order function.

因为在高阶函数的执行中，作为参数被传进的函数会被调出执行(be called)，所以参数函数叫做callback函数（回调函数）

### 模块化的好处
By isolating code into separate files, called modules, you can:
find, fix, and debug code more easily.
reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of your application.
keep information private and protected from other modules.
prevent pollution of the global namespace and potential naming collisions, by cautiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program.
